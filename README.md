- Bullet list
WebGoat is a platform designed for testing vulnerabilities and gaining a deeper understanding of web application security.</br>

Within this project, we identify vulnerabilities and engage in hands-on penetration testing. Detailed documentation of our findings is available here.</br>

This serves as an excellent starting point for penetration testers looking to get their hands dirty!</br>
